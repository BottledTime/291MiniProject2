Phase 1:
      data.py
      This file reads Amazon reviews from stdin and create data files.
      All input should be entered within one run of the program because
      the program try to remove the output files before it writes data
      if it exits. The program resets record number for each time it 
      runs, so the removing of existed output files ensures the 
      correctness of the indexing.

      Suppose raw review data is stored in data.txt, use following
      command to prepare data files.
      cat data.txt | python3 data.py

      reviews.txt, pterms.txt, rterms.txt, scores.txt
      These four files are created using the small data file with only
      10 recores provided on eclass.

Phase 2:
      Use the following commands to sort the files built in Phase 1.
      sort -o pterms.txt pterms.txt
      sort -o rterms.txt rterms.txt
      sort -o scores.txt scores.txt

      formatting.py
      This file reads from txt files created in Phase 1 and writes the 
      data to another file into the format db_load expects.
      
      break.pl
      This perl file is provided on eclass. But I did not use this one
      as it can only work with command lines.

      rw.txt, pt.txt, rt.txt, sc.txt
      These four files are generated by formatting.py. An example 
      command of creating rw.txt is:
            python3 formatting.py review.txt rw.txt

      rw.idx, pt.idx, rt.idx, sc.idx
      These four files are expected output file in Phase 2. They are
      created by db_load command and the correct format txt files
      above. 
      The commands are as follows:
      	  db_load -T -t hash -f rw.txt rw.idx
	  db_load -T -t btree -f pt.txt pt.idx
	  db_load -T -t btree -f rt.txt rt.idx
	  db_load -T -t btree -f sc.txt sc.idx
